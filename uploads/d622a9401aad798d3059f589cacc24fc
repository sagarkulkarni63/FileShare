Data Models:
i) Relational Data Model: Designs the data in the form of rows and columns within the table. Tables are also called relations. 
ii) Entity-Relationship Model: Logical representations of data as objects and relatioship among them. These objects are known as entities, 
and relationship is an association among these entities. A set of attributes describe the entities. A set of same type of entities is known as
'Entity Set' and set of same type of relationship is known as 'relationship set'.
iii) Object-based Data Model: Extension of the ER model with notions of functions, encapsulation, and objectidentity.
iv) Semistructured Data Model: It is different from all the three data models. It allows data specification at places
where the individual data items of the same type may have different attribute sets.

Logical representation of database is Schema.
The overall design of a database is called schema.
Database schema is the skeleton structure of the database. It's logical view of the entire database.
Schema contains schema objects like table, foreign key, primary key, columns, data types.
